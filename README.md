### Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and resources for implementing and visualizingthe Q-learning in a maze environment(Virtual and Physical).

## Project Structure

- **Action_Sequence.py** - Generates the sequence of actions taken by the agent during the virtual learning process. The Generated action sequence is used by the physical agen to solve the Identical Physical maze environment.
- **MazeCreation.py** - Give a good UserInterface to the user to generate the virtual maze environment where the Q-learning algorithm is applied.
- **QLearning.py** - Implements the Q-learning algorithm to train the Virtual agent in the selected virtual maze environment.
- **Training Visualization.py** - Provides a visual representation of the training process and learned policies using Pygame library.
- **Virtual Phase Implementation.mp4** - Video demonstrating the implementation and results of the Virtual Implementation of the project.
